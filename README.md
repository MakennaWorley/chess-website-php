This was my final project for my Databases class. I have decided to move the code into Django and discontinue my work in PHP. This is what was finished so far. In theory, everything should work but I haven't tested since the original submission where it was using the CMPT server at Westminster. Please use with caution (assuming you actually want to run this PHP project). I will post the project here on my github when I get the django working. But it's finals week so I've pretty busy right now.
